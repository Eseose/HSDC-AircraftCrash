# HSDC-AircraftCrash

This is a project by Team Vispy of the HDSC-21 Internship on airplane crashes data available at https://www.kaggle.com/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908


Data Analysis allows us to see the causes and make inferences from the data.


The  most common reasons for airplane crashes  as reported by an article from natlareview  are:

Pilot error

Mechanical Failure

Poor Weather


This project is set out to perform analysis on the airplane crashes data and agree with or refute the claims made by natlareview while proposing solutions to limit such occurrences
